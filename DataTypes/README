## Quick Start

1. Download `solidity-data-types-dictionary.html`
2. Open in any modern browser
3. Start searching or browsing types

No installation, dependencies, or internet connection required.

## Features

### 🔍 Instant Search
Type to filter across all data types by name, description, or use case. Find what you need in seconds.

### 🏷️ Category Filters
Quickly narrow down to:
- **Value Types** — Integers, booleans, addresses, bytes, enums
- **Reference Types** — Arrays, mappings, structs, strings
- **Special** — Data locations, function types, contract types

### 📖 Expandable Cards
Click any type card to reveal:
- Detailed descriptions
- Code examples you can reference
- Gas optimization tips
- Member functions and methods
- Common use cases

### ⚡ Quick Reference Panel
Default values for all types visible at a glance — no clicking required.

### 🌙 Dark Theme
Easy on the eyes during long coding sessions.

## What's Covered

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| **Integers** | uint8-uint256, int8-int256, gas optimization notes |
| **Boolean** | bool, operators (!, &&, \|\|, ==, !=) |
| **Address** | address, address payable, .balance, .transfer, .send, .call |
| **Bytes** | bytes1-bytes32, function selectors, hash storage |
| **Enums** | Custom enumerations, state machines |
| **Arrays** | T[], T[k], bytes, string, .push, .pop, .length |
| **Mappings** | Simple mappings, nested mappings, iteration patterns |
| **Structs** | Custom types, storage packing optimization |
| **Data Locations** | storage, memory, calldata with gas costs |
| **Special Types** | function types, contract types, type(X) |

## Code Examples

Every type includes practical Solidity code examples. For instance, the `address payable` entry shows all three methods for sending Ether:

```solidity
// Method 1: transfer (reverts on failure, 2300 gas limit)
payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);

// Method 2: send (returns false on failure, 2300 gas limit)
bool success = payable(msg.sender).send(1 ether);

// Method 3: call (RECOMMENDED - forwards all gas)
(bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: 1 ether}("");
require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
```

## Gas Tips

Throughout the dictionary, you'll find gas optimization insights like:

- Why `uint256` is often more efficient than smaller integer types
- Storage costs (~20,000 gas for new slots vs ~5,000 for updates)
- When to use `calldata` vs `memory` for function parameters
- Struct packing strategies to minimize storage slots

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome / Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

```

## Customization

The HTML file is self-contained with inline CSS and JavaScript. To customize:

- **Colors**: Modify the CSS variables in the `:root` selector
- **Content**: Edit the `typesData` object in the `<script>` section
- **Styling**: All styles are in the `<style>` block

## Adding New Types

To add a new type, locate the `typesData` object and add an entry:

```javascript
{
  name: "yourType",
  badge: "value",  // or "reference" or "special"
  description: "Brief description",
  example: `// Code example here`,
  useCase: "When to use this type",
  tip: "Optional helpful tip",
  gasNote: "Optional gas optimization note"
}
```
